## Projects

### 1. Project Name

- Description:**Bike sharing systems** are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able rent a bike from a one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world..
- Tools/Libraries:mongodb,python,sklearn,aws Ec2 and s3 bucket,Docker.
- Key Learnings: model with prediction accuracy more than 95%.
